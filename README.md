Introduction
Project Overview

The earthquake prediction model project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the occurrence of earthquakes with a certain level of accuracy. Earthquakes pose significant risks to communities and infrastructure, making accurate prediction an essential tool for disaster preparedness and mitigation efforts. By leveraging historical seismic data and relevant features, this project seeks to build a predictive model that can provide early warnings and insights into seismic activity.
Motivation

Earthquakes are natural disasters that can cause widespread destruction and loss of life. Despite advances in seismology and geophysics, accurately predicting earthquakes remains a challenging task. Developing effective prediction models can help mitigate the impact of earthquakes by enabling timely evacuation, infrastructure reinforcement, and emergency response planning. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to contribute to the development of tools that enhance earthquake preparedness and resilience.
