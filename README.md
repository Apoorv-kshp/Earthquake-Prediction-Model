Earthquake Prediction Model

    Overview: Developed a machine learning model to predict earthquakes using seismic data.
    Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
    Objective: To create a reliable model that can forecast earthquakes and help in taking preventive measures.
    Key Features:
        Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed seismic data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
        Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features from raw data to improve model performance.
        Model Development: Built and trained the model using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
        Performance Evaluation: Achieved a loss of 0.503 and an accuracy of 92.42% on the validation dataset.
    Impact: The model provides early warnings for potential earthquakes, contributing to disaster preparedness and risk reduction efforts.
